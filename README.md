# About

<div align="center">

CasChord is a Windows based audio routing software, designed to act as a whole home audio system using the cheapest hardware possible.

This application is compatible with any audio input or output that is normally visible to the windows sound manager, this includes virtual sound cards and mulitple identical audio devices.

## Basic Overview

The number of input sources and output zones is only limited to what Windows supports.

Supported inputs include those built into sound cards, mic in, line in and loopback.
Thrid-party virtual soundcards are also supported...

Input sources and output zones can be given custom names and or be hidden from main web user interface.

## Software Functions

The web ui or local API (documentaion included), are the main intended methods for user interaction. The Windows (Server side Software) does have a limited interface for inital configuration but the best user experience is using the aformentioned external interfaces.

____

The web gui has client identification, allowing for users to create and set custom themes per client device.
Options related to server side application functions, like custom device names and volume controls are syncronised across all clients.

To avoid issues, only one client can control the interface at a time, all other clients are blocked with a message. To regain control, users simply have to press a single button.
